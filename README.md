I'm an amateur coder - looking to skill up and learn more things!
I've worked in Wealth Management and Investment Finance, and have changed careers to software QA at a FinTech startup and I love it. I have some skills in Python and C++, and I'm learning more about these two languages and others while doing my Master's in CS at Tufts - so I can write more of my own code!
I spend most of my time @ work writing business use cases cases, finding and fixing bugs, reviewing regression, and helping customers adopt new releases.
When I'm not working - I enjoy Real Housewives of Atlanta, reading, hiking, road trips, hanging out with friends, and cooking. 
Check out my insta @trinidaddychike for all the food and outdoor pics.
