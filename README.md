I'm an amateur coder - looking to skill up and learn more things!
I've worked in Wealth Management and Investment Finance, and have changed careers to software QA at a FinTech startup and I love it. I QA in Python and C++, looking to learn those more in-depth from a development perspective - so I can write more of my own code!
I spend most of my time @ work parsing code, finding and fixing bugs, dealing with integration issues between/among various applications, and helping customers adopt new releases.
When I'm not working - I enjoy Real Housewives of Atlanta, reading, hiking, road trips, reading about social and economic issues, and cooking. 
Check out my insta @trinidaddychike for all the food and outdoor pics.
